Virtual Flea Market display for Boardgamegeek

Script that generates static pages based on Boardgamegeek lists for virtual flea markets. 
It makes it easier to see which games are available, compare to past sales, etc. Put it on a cron job
to keep it up to date.

It's recommended that people add the words "sold" or "traded" to their items so the script parses them as sold.
